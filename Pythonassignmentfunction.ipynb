    "\n",
    "The args syntax allows a function to accept any number of positional arguments. It collects all the positional arguments passed to the function into a tuple.

    "Both *args and **kwargs provide flexibility when defining functions that need to handle varying numbers of arguments. They are especially useful when designing generic functions or when you're unsure about the number of arguments that will be passed to a function."

    "Ans:- Python, a generator function is a special type of function that returns an iterator, known as a generator. It allows you to define an iterative algorithm by writing a single function, rather than creating a separate class with __iter__() and __next__() methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key feature of a generator function is the use of the yield keyword. When the generator function is called, it returns a generator object. Each time the yield keyword is encountered within the function, it temporarily suspends the function's execution and returns a value to the caller. The state of the function is then saved, allowing it to resume from where it left off when the next value is requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "The yield keyword is used to produce a series of values one at a time, without creating the entire sequence at once. It allows the generator function to generate values on-the-fly, conserving memory and improving performance in scenarios where generating all values at once would be inefficient.\n",
